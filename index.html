          <p><strong>"Rayaan loved the swim class with Austin! He said he learned lots of good techniques! He wished he could
          take classes from him regularly this summer at the neighborhood pool."</strong> - Sameena Akbar</p>
          <p><strong>"It is very grateful to have those lovely young people to volunteering teach swimming lessons. It is very
            meaningful and valuable way to give back to the community. Thanks for their enthusiasm, dedication
          and patience, my son got impressive advice from them which made a  highly positive impact on my son’s
          swimming confidences and his swimming skills. The most hard work is to teaching my 4 years old son,
          which I believe is kind of mission impossible. Thanks for all their hard working. The whole family do
          appreciate."</strong> - DanXi Zhao</p>
